Are Movies getting shorter over time? Let's Find Out!

The aim is to assess Netflix movie data and ascertain whether there is a decline in movie durations.

**Approach:**
 I Utilized Python libraries, specifically pandas and matplotlib, for data exploration and visualization. The data was filtered for movies, and an analysis of duration was conducted based on release year and genre. Scatter plots were generated to discern trends and patterns.

**Key Insights:**
No distinct downward trend was observed in the overall duration of movies across various release years. Movie duration exhibited significant variation both within and between genres. Although, Children's movies and documentaries generally displayed shorter durations compared to genres like action and drama.

**Inference:**
There may be evolving storytelling trends within specific genres, adapting to audience preferences or platform constraints. Investigating the correlation between movie length and audience engagement in the streaming era is imperative.

However,Further analysis through statistical tests is essential to validate the significance of genre-specific patterns by Performing statistical tests to confirm the significance of genre-specific findings. Explore factors beyond runtime, such as storytelling techniques and audience demographics, to comprehend the drivers behind variations in movie length.
